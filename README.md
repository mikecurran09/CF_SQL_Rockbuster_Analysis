# CF_SQL_Rockbuster_Analysis

SQL analysis of the PostgreSQL Sample Database as part of the Data Analysis course at Careerfoundry.

## Objective
Rockbuster is an imaginary DVD rental business that is competing in the online streaming rental industry. To that end, they want to gather insights about the success of their present portfolio as well as their client base so that they may better guide their business plan.

## Data
PostgreSQL's open-source course data is accessible [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip).

## Results
With most clients in India & China, this area was chosen to launch online movie renting. There was no apparent pattern in the movie portfolio's profitability, therefore it was advised to utilize the best-performing licenses online.
